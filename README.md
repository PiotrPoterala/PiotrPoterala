Hi, Iâ€™m @PiotrPoterala. I am a firmware engineer, a fan of electronics (in particular microcontrollers with 32-bit cores from the Cortex family), and a passionate CMM. 
I am a constructor-electronics engineer who, since he got angry with SINUMERIC, has been creating my own solutions for controlling CNC machine tools. You can reach me on zappp.pl
